OLC NIFA Data Cube Datasets

This repository organizes key geospatial, environmental, and socio-cultural datasets used in the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) NIFA Data Cube project.
These datasets support research, education, and land stewardship — including work with the Pine Ridge Reservation and surrounding regions.

Overview

The OLC NIFA Data Cube integrates multi-source datasets for ecological, climate, and land-use research in the Northern Great Plains region.
The project emphasizes Tribal data sovereignty, open science, and land-based education.

All data are intended for research, education, and conservation purposes — and should be used following proper attribution and data sharing agreements, particularly for Tribal and culturally sensitive data.
